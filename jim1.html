    hobby
    I have many hobbies, but my favorite one is photography, because photography can bring me relaxation. 
    When recording beautiful scenery through a camera, I can save my mood during shooting and share it with others.
    travel
    Because I like photography, I have traveled time and again to appreciate the infinite scenery of nature.
    Through traveling, I have brought me different experiences, such as adventure, ease, and comfort.
    learn
    In this long life, I have learned a lot, such as writing, drums and photography.
     Writing can calm my mood and calm it down. 
     Drum stands can vent my emotions when I'm upset, so photography doesn't have to say much. It's a hobby.
