     <div class="column">
          <h2>learn</h2>
          <p class="es">
    In this long life, I have learned a lot, such as writing, drums and photography.
    Writing can calm my mood and calm it down. 
   Drum stands can vent my emotions when I'm upset, so photography doesn't have to say much. It's a hobby.
